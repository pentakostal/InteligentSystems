	Personal suggestions for code refactoring. I would trying to avoid arrays as much as possible, even if they are associative. I personally created class, witch will be like a collection of data/values. It also give me more flexibility in the code. It also can become more readable.
	I also mentioned about “code structure broken” it may be a git glich, because I view code in browser, but then I transfer it to IDE the structure was correct.
	About variables names. According to latest PSR standards we are not using sneak case in name variables. There is many places in code where PSR standards are not observed.





<br>Task 2.
<br>    • Line 3: the “css” object should be named in a more meaningful way, such as “styles”.
<br>    • Line 7: spelling mistake “CarsFuuel”, maybe better “CarsFuel”.
<br>    • Line 11-26: the alert component can be simplified by using a ternary operator.
<br>    • Line 28-59: the “App” component can be refactored to a functional component with hooks instead of a class component. To simplify the code and make it easier to maintain. 
<br>    • Line 39: the “updateCoordinates” method should be moved to a separate helper function instead of being called within the component.
<br>    • Line 40: it's better to use “setTimeout” instead of “setInterval” to avoid overlapping executions of the function.
<br>    • Line 49: grammar mistake in variable name.
<br>    • Line 53-56: the JSX code should be indented properly for better readability.

	I recommended to include try-catch blocks or error handling logic to prevent unexpected behavior.
